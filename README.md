## My Story
My background is in Graphic Design and have been working as an in-house Graphic Designer for many years. A few years back, I decided to do a Masters degree to brush up on my skills. Having successfully completed it, I noticed how much I love to code and working out solutions to the things I design, the Masters was entirely art/design based. So I decided to learn how to code. The journey is long and requires a lot of practice. And this is why I decided to join the #100DaysOfCode challenge, to chanel some practice but also to show potential employers what I can do and how I got there.

## The Challenge

After forking the repo mentioned above, I decided to change the files. Since this is my journey and I do not intend to merge with the original repo, I think I am allowed (I hope!).

This will also give me practice on how to use Git and Github. Although I have watched tutorial videos, I still find it slightly confusing.

So here it starts (or continues, depends on how you see it)... my journey with coding.
