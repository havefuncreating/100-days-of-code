### Day 30: 10th May 2017 
##### freeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: New Beta freeCodeCamp curriculum

**Thoughts:** Today I decided to do the beta version of the new freeCodeCamp curriculum. It is better laid out providing certifications for every different level of subjects. I only did about 5 hours today and I nearly finished the Responsive Web Design. It has an interesting section about Accessibility which was useful to go through. I prefer this new curriculum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 29: 9th May 2017 
##### freeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Learning JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Super pleased with myself, finished the Basic JavaScript section of freeCodeCamp!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 28: 8th May 2017 
##### freeCodeCamp

**Today's Progress**: Learning JavaScript

**Thoughts:** Today I decided to continue on the JavaScript lessons of FFC. I enjoy these lessons as they truly give you a practical understanding of the code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 27: 7th May 2017 
##### MVA Training

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** Same as yesterday. Watching the MVA Training Tutorials. They are rather easy and to be honest, I am only watching them so I can get a certification for it. I do not believe this is one of the best tutorials out there.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 26: 6th May 2017 
##### MVA Training

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** Watching the MVA Training Tutorials. They are rather easy and to be honest, I am only watching them so I can get a certification for it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 25: 5th May 2017 
##### Labrador Website

**Today's Progress**: Learning/re-designing

**Thoughts:** After yesterday, I spent some time reading a website template I got for free from the plethora of stock websites. I wanted to see how the developer managed to create certain behaviours. This just proved to me, that the best way to learn is to read someone else's code. I know video tutorials help but nothing beats practice. For my labrador website I want to put certain animations that are triggered by the mouse scrolling. And now I know how to achieve this. Therefore, spent some time re-designing the pages to something that will suit this new feature. Now I feel like I am making progress.

As a side issue, saw that Microsoft are doing the Learning Challenge. I signed up for the Web Developer one. The first video was very good to watch. The second tutorial has taught me that I am most certainly not a beginner anymore. I know HTML5 and CSS3, time to stop thinking I am only starting out on those! And by the way, I still find Lynda.com tutorials better for learning.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 24: 4th May 2017 
##### Atom/Git/Github

**Today's Progress**: Learning

**Thoughts:** Today I finished learning and setting up my Atom how I want it. I also took some time to learn more about Git and Github. I also spent some time looking at online courses to see which ones to do next. Going through freeCodeCamp, and although it is good, I feel I need to find another and go through it. Sometimes getting a different perspective helps. Also learned what React actually is. I had no idea. Now I am even more keen on mastering JavaScript, moving to React and Node.js.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 23: 3rd May 2017 
##### Atom

**Today's Progress**: Deleted Dreamweaver, downloaded Atom

**Thoughts:** Really fed up with Adobe Dreamweaver, the developer mode. Although looks great it is just not perfect and it keeps going wrong. So downloaded Atom and spent the day playing with it and learning how to use it. So no code day per se, but will make my workflow better and faster.

### Day 21: 1st May 2017 
##### Labrador Website

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Labrador website

### Day 19: 29th April 2017 
##### Labrador Website

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Labrador website

**Thoughts:** Designers can be picky... and I am one hell of a picky designer. I changed pages yet again as I was not happy how images were looking. So re-coded the pages so all images fill the available space. Coded the index page and changed the jumbotron boxes so it suits how I want it. I will stop now... I want to move on to the puppies and the dog's life pages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 18: 28th April 2017 
##### Labrador Website

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Labrador website

**Thoughts:** Decided to change the front page. I am finding that although Bootstrap saves time in coding. It really does not have everything. You still have to do a lot yourself. Sometimes it is faster if you just code it yourself!

### Day 15: 25th April 2017 
##### Labrador Website

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Labrador website

**Thoughts:** Decided to change the timeline of the dogs to simple card layouts. I think it will make it look a lot better and more dynamic. Still trying to fix the centering of the cards. Frustrating, but need to give it a break and re-cap tomorrow with a more clear mind.

##### Worked on the Labrador website and did some JavaScript Training

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Labrador website. Only a little bit of coding

**Thoughts:** I have a lot of images to edit for the website, so that took most of my available time. I did a little of JavaScript training on FreeCodeCamp in order to make up the lost coding time.

##### Worked on the Labrador website

**Today's Progress**: I worked on the Labrador website, adding the timeline to Rosie's page with a pop up window that will show images

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 8: 18th April 2017 
##### Developed more of the labrador website

**Today's Progress**: I developed more of the website. Also, added the Animate.css to give the pages a dynamic look.

**Thoughts:** Very happy with the progress, spent most of the time planning and editing images for the site. Bootstrap is really easy to use. Animate is also super easy, this will add some funky animations to my pages.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 7: 17th April 2017 
##### Practiced jQuery

**Today's Progress**: Wanted to do something different so I started jQuery section of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure about the hours it says I'm suppose to take. FreeCodeCamp says it takes 3 hours to do the jQuery section and I managed it in less than 1hour. Not sure how on earth you take 3 hours to do?!?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 5: 15th April 2017 
##### Working on the Labrador website

**Thoughts:** Happy with the progress I am doing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 4: 14th April 2017 
##### Working on the Labrador website

**Today's Progress**: Been working further on the navigation of the website and adding carousel to the front page.

**Thoughts:** Feel comfortable using bootstrap. However, I do find it limiting with colour choices. So still have to write my own CSS to get a site as I want it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 3: 13th April 2017 
##### Starting a new website

**Today's Progress**: I set up a new website called 'My Labradors'. I am using what I have learned of Boostrap and I intend to use CSS animations.

**Thoughts:** Very happy to start creating a website, I enjoy coding. And the subject matter that I chose is perfect. A fun website about my doggies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 2: 12th April 2017 
##### Finishing Bootstrap Training

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Lynda.com Bootstrap4 course and the Bootstrap section of Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is really easy to use, just a matter of remembering all the different classes you can have. I can now start designing my new website using Bootstrap, so I can practice and add to my portfolio.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Day 1: 11th April 2017 
##### Starting the challenge

**Today's Progress**: Forked a repo for the first time, edited the files on it! Continued my Bootstrap4 learning with Lynda.com. Today I focused on forms and how to style them.

**Thoughts:** Github can be scary when you are not used to it. So doing this challenge will help me understand it better. Bootstrap is quite easy to use. It is just a matter of learning the different classes and where to put them. Helps that I know how to use CSS and HTML well.
