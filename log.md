# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 11th April 2017 
##### Starting the challenge

**Today's Progress**: Forked a repo for the first time, edited the files on it! Continued my Bootstrap4 learning with Lynda.com. Today I focused on forms and how to style them.

**Thoughts:** Github can be scary when you are not used to it. So doing this challenge will help me understand it better. Bootstrap is quite easy to use. It is just a matter of learning the different classes and where to put them. Helps that I know how to use CSS and HTML well.
