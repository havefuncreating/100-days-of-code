# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: 13th April 2017 
##### Starting a new website

**Today's Progress**: I set up a new website called 'My Labradors'. I am using what I have learned of Boostrap and I intend to use CSS animations.

**Thoughts:** Very happy to start creating a website, I enjoy coding. And the subject matter that I chose is perfect. A fun website about my doggies.

### Day 2: 12th April 2017 
##### Finishing Bootstrap Training

**Today's Progress**: I finished the Lynda.com Bootstrap4 course and the Bootstrap section of Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap is really easy to use, just a matter of remembering all the different classes you can have. I can now start designing my new website using Bootstrap, so I can practice and add to my portfolio.

### Day 1: 11th April 2017 
##### Starting the challenge

**Today's Progress**: Forked a repo for the first time, edited the files on it! Continued my Bootstrap4 learning with Lynda.com. Today I focused on forms and how to style them.

**Thoughts:** Github can be scary when you are not used to it. So doing this challenge will help me understand it better. Bootstrap is quite easy to use. It is just a matter of learning the different classes and where to put them. Helps that I know how to use CSS and HTML well.
