# Resources I have used

## Projects and Ideas
1. [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)<br />
  This one I am currently doing
2. [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)<br />
  Will do this one once I finished the one above!

## Lynda.com playlist
1. [Lucia's Essential Front-End Developer Skills](https://www.lynda.com/SharedPlaylist/574b2afedbb9492a8eb4f44ee596244f)<br />
  I put together this playlist of the best courses I have done on Lynda that have helped me with learning how to code.

## Udemy Courses
Once I have finished a few I shall mention them. Still prefer the Lynda courses for learning.

## Facebook Groups
1. [Newbie Coder Warehouse](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1594816820775537)<br />
  If it wasn't for this group I would not have learned about the #100DaysOfCode challenge. Very useful group to get links to free tutorials, resources, as well as, experiences from other newbie coders.
